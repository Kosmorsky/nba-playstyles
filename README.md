## Note
This was my second machine learning project, and first time implementing unsupervised learning. 

As a huge NBA (and video game) fan, I got this idea from the NBA 2K games, in which each player is labeled with a "playstyle" in addition to their positions.

Since the NBA is evolving (being called a "positionless league" by analysts), I wanted to see if I could cluster players into unique categories that could explain the way they play more accurately than their listed positions. I could then use the players' playstyles from NBA 2K to compare my findings.

In addition, I was able to look at how the commonality of each playstyle has fluctuated throughout the years as the game has changed.

This was probably my favorite project so far, so I hope you can enjoy it half as much as I did!
